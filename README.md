## Requirements  

- Python 3.x  
- MySQL Server  
- Python Libraries:  
  - `mysql-connector-python` (install using `pip install mysql-connector-python`)  

---

## Setup and Installation  

1. **Install MySQL**:  
   Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system. Create a database named `freelancer_db` and a table `projects` using the following SQL commands:  

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE freelancer_db;

   USE freelancer_db;

   CREATE TABLE projects (
       project_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       client_name VARCHAR(100),
       status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
       payment FLOAT
   );
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Libraries**:  
   Run the following command to install the MySQL connector library:  
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Clone or Download the Project**:  
   Save the Python code to a file, e.g., `fpms.py`.

4. **Configure MySQL Connection**:  
   Update the `connect_db` function in the code with your MySQL username, password, and host details:  
   ```python
   def connect_db():
       return mysql.connector.connect(
           host="localhost",
           user="root",
           password="",  # Replace with your MySQL password
           database="freelancer_db"
       )
   ```

## Usage Instructions  

1. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python fpms.py
   ```

2. Use the console menu to interact with the system:  
   - Add a new project by entering the project name, client name, and payment amount.  
   - View all projects stored in the database.  
   - Update an existing projectâ€™s status and payment.  
   - Delete a project using its project ID.  

3. Exit the program by selecting the "Exit" option.
